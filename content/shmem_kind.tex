\end{Csynopsis}

\begin{apiarguments}
    \apiargument{IN}{size}{The size, in bytes, of a block to be
        allocated from the symmetric heap. This argument is of type
        \VAR{size\_t}}
    \apiargument{IN}{alignment}{Byte alignment of the block allocated from the
        symmetric heap.}
    \apiargument{IN}{partition\_id}{Integer to identify the user-defined memory
        partition on which the symemtric heap is created}
\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_malloc} routine returns a pointer to a block of at
    least \VAR{size} bytes suitably aligned for any use.  This space is
    allocated from the symmetric heap created on the user-defined memory
    partition with characteristics associated with the partition\_id(in
    contrast to \FUNC{malloc}, which allocates from the private heap).
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_align} routine allocates a block in the symmetric
    heap heap created on the user-defined memory partition with characteristics
    associated with the partition\_id that has a byte alignment specified by the
    alignment argument. }

\apireturnvalues{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_malloc} routine returns a pointer to the allocated
    space; otherwise, it returns a \CONST{NULL} pointer.
    
    The \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_align} routine returns an aligned pointer to the
    allocated space; otherwise, it returns a \CONST{NULL} pointer. }

\apinotes{ Requirements for all PEs to use \FUNC{shmem\_malloc} and
    \FUNC{shmem\_align} memory management routines are the same for
    \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_malloc} and \FUNC{shmem\_kind\_align} routines. 
}

\apiimpnotes{
    In a quality implementation \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} and \FUNC{shmem\_free}
    should also handle the symmetric memory partitions correctly. It is
    assumed that the new memory address returned on \FUNC{shmem\_realloc} will
    be in the same symmetric memory partition associated with the input
    address. }
